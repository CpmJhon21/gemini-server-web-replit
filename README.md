### API Key Configuration

The first time you run the server, it will prompt you to enter your Gemini API Key. You can obtain the API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey). Follow the instructions to generate a new API key and enter it in the terminal when prompted.

The key will be saved locally, so you wonâ€™t need to re-enter it the next time you run the server.

### Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with AI Assistant via the **chatbot** interface on your browser. Type your prompt in the input box, and the AI will generate content in response.

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with API Key configuration, ensure that you have entered a valid key. If the key is missing or invalid, the tool will prompt you to enter a new one.
- Ensure that your local server is running on `http://localhost:3000`. If it is not, check for errors in the terminal and ensure all dependencies are installed correctly.
